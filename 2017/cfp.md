# Call for Proposals

We are inviting the Julia community to submit talks and workshop proposals for
the upcoming JuliaCon (June 20th-24th, Berkeley, CA, USA).
This Call for Proposals closes on **March 25th, 11:59pm SST**.

JuliaCon is the fourth annual Julia community meetining. We encourage everyone
to consider submitting a proposal, regardless of your level of experience with
Julia or as a speaker. If you work with Julia in any form we want to hear from you!

## Topics

Over the years JuliaCon presentations have ranged from introductory to advanced
and have been from industry and academia. To get a feel for previous years
presentations, take a look at our past programmes and recordings
([2014](/2014/), [2015](/2015/talks.html), [2016](/2016/)).

We are interested in all topics that have to do with Julia and the list below is definitely not complete. 

* Industry applications
* Finance & Economics
* Machine Learning
* Statistics
* Numerical optimization 
* Scientific computing
* Bioinformatics 
* Data visualization
* Julia’s Compiler, Tooling & Ecosystem

The most important consideration is whether **you** think it would be interesting.

## Proposal types

**Talks** are 30 minutes long, with 5 minutes allocated for questions from the audience.  
**Lightning talks** are 10 minutes long, with 2 minutes allocated for questions from the audience.  
**Workshops** are two to three hours long and are either in-depth tutorials or interactive hackathon sessions.  

If you have other ideas or suggestions, like a topic or focus of a hackathon,
please let us know and we will see what we can do.

## Proposal Advice

* Submit proposals early as it allows us to contact you and give feedback if necessary.
* When thinking about what makes a good topic, ask yourself what kind of presentation  
  would make you or your friends excited. 
* Great talks are generally about your own experience. How do you use Julia in your work?  
  How does Julia affect you and your code? What's holding you back from going all the way?   
  What makes a specific package good and how does it work? What needs improving?
* It may be a good idea to review previous presentations for inspiration and ideas.
* If you are presenting about a certain project, package, or company,  
  include links to guide the reader to more information. 
* Try not to assume familiarity with your subject when writing the abstract,  
  the average reader is most likely not an expert in your area of expertise. 
* Avoid opaque titles; while witty titles are good, an informative title is essential. 
* Avoid infomercials, while we love to hear how you use Julia in your company,  
  note that JuliaCon is not the place to sell your product. 
* If you want feedback before submitting a proposal, contact us at juliacon@googlegroups.com
  well ahead of the deadline. We are more than happy to help you improve your proposal. 

If you have doubts about becoming a speaker, check out the website

We look forward to your proposals and to seeing you at JuliaCon 2017.  

## The fine print

### Submission process

We are using an anonymized submissions process, to avoid selection bias related to the speaker.

### Recordings and Slides

We plan to record all talks and will make them available after the conference.
We do this for those who can’t attend. If you are uncomfortable with having your talk recorded,
please let any member of the committee know. Being recorded is not a requirement to attend
JuliaCon or to give a presentation. Finally, we would also ask you to make your
materials and recording available under a [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)
(default: no commercial reuse) or other [open source](https://opensource.org/licenses) license.
