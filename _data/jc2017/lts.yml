  abstract: >
    Standards already exist to improve software readability, but code understandable by a colleague differs from the best code to present to a student.  As a scientist, I have often had to jump from mathematics or pseudo-code to a fully fledged implementation, with no chance to gain purchase in an intermediate middle ground.  In the last year, I have worked on a Julia blog in computational physics and numerics and have striven to write code comprehensible to someone unfamiliar with the fundamental principles of the algorithm.  In this talk, I will display both good and bad examples of documentation and tutorials, as well as guidelines for improvement.

  title: "Improving Biological Network Inference with Julia"
  abstract: >
    In the multi-disciplinary field of systems biology, we welcome the opportunity that Julia brings for writing fast software with simple syntax. Speed is important in an age when biological datasets are increasing in size and analyses are becoming computationally more expensive. One example is the problem of determining how genes within a cell interact with one another. In the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRN) we seek to detect relationships between genes through statistical dependencies in biological data, and as datasets grow, so does computation time. Some algorithms use measures from information theory, which are suitable for detecting nonlinear biological relationships, but incur a high computational cost. We developed InformationMeasures.jl, a package for calculating information theoretic measures. The improvement in performance of our Julia package compared to widely-used packages in other languages enables us to develop new algorithms with higher complexity, examining triples, rather than pairs, of genes. These we can show are more successful than pairwise methods (in simulated data where the underlying GRNs are known), and scale well to the size of the largest currently-available biological datasets.

    The recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence are amazing, and Julia seems poised to play a significant role in these fields. Yet, in order to have real value within a company, data scientists must be able to get their models off of their laptops and deployed within a company’s distributed data pipelines and production infrastructure. In this talk, we will implement an ML model locally and talk about the trouble we can get into taking this to production. Then, against all odds, we will actually deploy the model in a scalable manner to a production cluster. Now that’s a pretty good 10 minutes!

    TheoSea (for THEOry SEArch) is a Julia meta-program that discovers compact
    theories from data if they exist. It writes candidate theories in Julia
    and then validates: tossing the bad theories and keeping the good
    theories. Compactness is measured by a metric, such as the number of
    space-time derivatives. A theory can consist of more than one well-formed
    formula over a mathematical language. The underlying algorithm is optimal
    in terms of compactness, although it may be combinatorially explosive for
    non-compact theories. TheoSea is now working on re-discovering the
    source-free Maxwell equations and the wave equation of light. There are
    many applications.

  abstract: >
    Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) is an optimization algorithm for solving large, multi-stage stochastic programming problems. It is well known in the electricity community, but has received little attention in other application areas. The algorithm is computationally demanding as it typically involves iteratively solving hundreds of thousands of linear programs. In the past, implementations have been coded in slow, but expressive mathematical optimization languages such as AMPL, or in fast, but low level languages such as C++. In this talk, we detail a JuMP extension we have developed to solve problems using SDDP. We also present benchmarks showing that our Julia implementation has similar run-times to a previous version developed in C++, while being more flexible and expressive. This speed and flexibility has allowed us to revisit assumptions made in previous work, as well as apply the SDDP algorithm to problems as diverse as agriculture, energy, and finance.

    WebIO acts as a small Julian bridge between browser-based UIs to Julia such as IJulia, Atom, Blink and Mux, and packages that wish to output rich, interactive widgets. This means graphics packages don't have to depend on IJulia or Atom or Blink etc to create widgets. Instead they only depend on WebIO and use its abstractions. Widgets written with WebIO once will work on all the above interfaces. Some features are:

    * A DSL for creating HTML elements

    * A Julia-to-JavaScript transpiler

    * transparent and easy communication with observable refs

    * Ability to reliably load arbitrary JS libraries from the web / serve them from disk with correct ordering of code execution. (This has plagued many a package so far)

    * Flexible. Not tied into any javascript framework, no opinions. Allows you to execute arbitrary JS on your widgets.

    * Allows mixing and mashing widgets and concepts from different packages seamlessly, resulting in arbitrarily granular separation of concerns. Enables an ecosystem of UI packages, as opposed to Escher's monolithic codebase.

  title: "Exploring Evolutionary Dynamics of Communications in Bacteria Using Julia"
  abstract: >
    Many species of bacteria are able to collectively sense and respond to their environment. This communication form known as quorum-sensing (QS) can be achieved through the production of small molecules that are able to freely diffuse across cell membranes. These molecules (autoinducers) can subsequently be detected by other individuals in the population and once a threshold limit is reached, then this may cause a change in gene expression which allows bacteria to coordinate their activities such as biofilm formation, virulence and antibiotic resistance. Despite the widespread interest in QS from molecular mechanisms to social evolution and pathogen control, there is still controversy over the basic evolutionary function of QS. Using Julia as the agent-based modeling platform, we have been able to investigate the rewards and risks of coordination and cooperation in QS. In this talk, I will briefly introduce the research background and share some of our results obtained from in silico evolution using Julia. This work is important as it sheds light on how simple signal-mediated behavioral rules can shape complex collective behaviors in bacteria. Julia greatly helped simplify the modeling precess and speed up simulations.

    Julia has the potential to become a major programming language in economics. In this presentation I will suggest a new way to calibrate models of economic growth. For that purpose I use a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm (the Klara package) and I repeatedly solve for the roots of a big system of nonlinear equations using the JuMP and Ipopt packages. With this approach I am able to estimate the distributions of parameter values which drive long-run economic growth and project confidence intervals of macroeconomic variables into the future. For this purpose Julia is the best programming language that I know of, because it combines a great range of functionalities and at the same time it is very fast. To conclude, I will reflect on some challenges that came up during the project.

    Convex optimization problems require rigorous mathematical understanding to solve them.

As it became popular, we saw increased demand to support optimization over complex numbers, from users working in diverse scientific fields including power grid optimization, quantum information theory, wireless communication, and signal processing. Previously, these users relied on various tools such as MATLAB’s cvx and open-source python package PICOS to tackle different problems depending upon their domain of work. Convex’s new support for complex numbers allows users to approach each of these problems in Julia. In this talk, I will show how to the new functionality in Convex.jl provides a single integrated solution for many types of Disciplined Convex Programming Problems and show how to solve complex problems using Convex.jl in very few lines of code, taking examples from scientific domains mentioned above. I will also present benchmarks comparing Convex.jl with competing open-source tools.

  abstract: >
    At present, two options exist for saving Julia data structures to disk: Julia's built-in serializer and the JLD (Julia data) package. The built-in serializer achieves reasonable performance, but uses a non-standardized format that differs by Julia version and processor architecture. JLD saves data structures in a standardized format (HDF5), but has substantial overhead when saving large numbers of mutable objects. In this talk, I describe the design of JLD2, a re-implementation of JLD. By replacing JLD's dependency on the HDF5 library with a pure Julia implementation of a subset of HDF5, JLD2 achieves performance comparable to Julia's built-in serializer, while writing files readable by standard HDF5 implementations. Additionally, JLD2 resolves numerous issues with the previous JLD format and implementation.

  abstract: >
    The parallel application of multiple statistical hypothesis tests is one of the fundamental patterns of exploratory data analysis for big datasets. This becomes essential in various fields of scientific research, such as in high-throughput biology, medicine and imaging where one is routinely faced with millions of tests.  The goal is to protect against spurious discoveries with rigorous statistical error control guarantees, while simultaneously providing enough power to detect needles in a haystack. Here, we present MultipleTesting.jl, a package that provides a unified interface for classical and modern multiple testing methods. We give a quick introduction to the underlying statistical concepts and show how Julia is ideally suited for such an endeavour: First, most multiple testing procedures consist of a standard set of primitives, such as p-values, adjusted p-values and hypothesis weights. Second, elaborate (multiple testing) algorithms often consist of simpler components in a plug-and-play fashion; these include estimators of the proportion of true null hypotheses, parametric as well as non-parametric distribution estimators, and statistical machine learning techniques. All of these ideas can be abstracted away by Julia's type system and multiple dispatch. Third, Julia provides the computational performance which is necessary when analyzing millions of hypotheses. We believe MultipleTesting.jl complements the growing number of high quality statistics packages in Julia's ecosystem.

  title: "Automatically Deriving Test Data for Julia Functions"
  abstract: >
    The use of multiple dispatch in Julia’s standard library and user-written functions presents a challenge for automated techniques of generating test data. In order to exercise all the methods that implement a function, the generation technique must generate test data with diverse data types, but traditional techniques typically focus solely on diverse data values and implicitly assume a constant data type. In this talk, I will demonstrate our solution to this challenge which automatically learns an effective probability distribution over types and methods that create instances of these types. I will explain how we used this approach to fuzz-test some common arithmetic and string functions in the Julia standard library, in the process identifying three faults.

  abstract: >
    Complex systems in biology are often difficult to treat analytically using mathematics and expensive to investigate with empirical methods. Moreover, deterministic approaches are misleading in systems that exhibit noise (e.g. rare events akin to mutation and extinction). Stochastic simulation provides investigators with the ability to simulate complex systems by integrating mathematical rigor and biological insight. However, simulations are slow, computationally expensive, and difficult to implement in software. My goal in developing [BioSimulator.jl](https://github.com/alanderos91/BioSimulator.jl) is to provide investigators with a tool that enables (1) quick and intuitive model prototyping, (2) efficient simulation, (3) visualization of simulation output, and (4) implementing new stochastic simulation algorithms. Using the Julia language allowed us to meet all four criteria with relative ease and extend to parallelized simulations. My talk will describe the theory underlying BioSimulator.jl, highlight aspects of our implementation, and present a few numerical examples.

    Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is being generated at an unprecedented rate. Analysis of WGS data requires a flexible data format to store the different types of DNA variation. A new WGS variant data format “SeqArray” was proposed recently (Zheng X, etc, 2017 Bioinformatics), which outperforms text-based variant call format (VCF) in terms of access efficiency and file size.

    Here I introduce a new Julia package “JSeqArray” for data manipulation of genotypes and annotations in an array-oriented manner (https://github.com/CoreArray/JSeqArray). It enables users to write portable and immediately usable code in the wider scientific ecosystem. When used in conjunction with the in-built multiprocessing and job-oriented functions for parallel execution, the JSeqArray package provides users a flexible and high-performance programming environment for analysis of WGS variant data. In the presentation, the examples of calculating allele frequencies, principal component analysis and association tests of linear regression will be given.

  title: "Solving Geophysical Inverse Problems with the jInv.jl Framework:  Seeing Underground with Julia"
  abstract: >
    Geophysical inversion is the mathematical and computational process of estimating the spatial distribution of physical properties of the earth's subsurface from remote measurements. It's a key tool in applied geophysics, which is generally concerned with determining the structure and composition of the earth's interior without direct sampling. At JuliaCon 2017 I would like to discuss our group's efforts to develop a modular, scalable, and extensible framework for solving geophysical inverse problems and other partial differential equation (PDE) constrained parameter estimation problems in Julia.

    To solve PDE constrained parameter estimation problems we need advanced algorithms for optimization, for the solution of PDEs, and the ability to efficiently share information between these domains. Our framework, called jInv---short for JuliaInversion---provides modular building block routines for these tasks that allow users to easily write their own software to solve new problems. The framework heavily uses Julia's multiple dispatch to allow for extensibility and generic programming.

    It is also critical that software implementations of these algorithms can scale to large distributed computing systems. jInv allows users to exploit the parallelism in geophysical inverse problems without detailed knowledge of Julia's parallel computing constructs.

    The first main goal of my talk is to discuss our approach to exploiting parallelism in geophysical inverse problems and how it has been implemented in jInv. The second goal is to illustrate, through examples of developing jInv modules for new geophysical problems, how we've moved jInv from a research project for the benefit of our own group to a tool that can be of use to the wider community.

    Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in the department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver Canada. Academically I'm interested in developing new computational methods for solving geophysical imaging problems. Since coming to UBC Julia has become my language of choice and I now consider myself a reformed Fortran programmer.

  title: "Junet: Towards Better Network Analysis in Julia"
  abstract: >
    I will present Junet — a new package for network analysis that seeks to be a fast and hackable alternative to mainstream network analysis libraries like NetworkX, igraph, and graph-tool. Unlike other Julia packages, it allows to quickly traverse and modify the graphs as well as to associate the attributes with their nodes and edges. I will discuss the data structures implemented in Junet and showcase how specific Julia's features allow to make them efficient. For example, thanks to parametric types it is possible to shrink the memory consumed by Junet to a fraction of what other libraries require. And conjunction of multiple dispatch with just-in-time compilation allows to optimize some methods based on the specific types they operate on, sometimes eliminating the computation altogether. The talk will also overview things that are experimental and don't work so well like creating zero-cost iterators and parallelizing loops. Finally, I will present the benchmarks comparing Junet with state-of-the-art libraries for network analysis.

  title: "Continuous-Time Point-Process Factor Analysis in Julia"
  abstract: >
    Neurons throughout the brain, and particularly in the cerebral cortex, represent many quantities of interest using population codes. Latent variable models of neural population activity may be seen as attempting to identify the value, time-evolution and encoding of such internal variables from neural data alone. They do so by seeking a small set of underlying processes that can account for the coordinated activity of the population.

    We introduce a novel estimation method [1] for latent factor models for point processes that operates on continuous spike times. Our method is based on score matching for point process regressions [2] adapted to population recordings with latent processes formed by mixing basis functions.

    The basis functions are represented as either Fourier modes, or functions living in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, parametrised using MLKernels. The method requires the kernel matrix as well as the first and second derivatives thereof, which we can compute efficiently via the Calculus package, making use of anonymous functions. Parameter estimation is then closed form and thus lightning fast up to normalisation, but afterwards we need to estimate the total intensity in the observation period. The approximation of the time integral relies on Cubature.jl.

    Due to its speed, this method enables neuroscientists to visualise latent processes in real time during experimental recordings and immediate compare them to their expectations, thus quickening the Planning-Design-Analysis loop by a large margin.

  title: "JuliaDB"
  abstract: >
     JuliaDB.jl is an end-to-end all-Julia data analysis platform incorporating storage, parallelism and compute into a single model. One can load a pile of CSV files into JuliaDB as a distributed table. JuliaDB will index the files and save the index for efficient lookup of subsets of the data later. You can also convert the data from the CSV files into an efficient memory mappable binary format ("ingest").

     This talk will be a brief introduction to the basic primitives of JuliaDB and how to use them."

  title: "Heavy-duty pricing of Fixed Income financial contracts with Julia"
  abstract: >
    The pricing of bonds or a Credit Portfolio usually has simple mathematics. However, when faced with a big portfolio, careful design is crucial for a fast execution time. I'll show how I designed a solution to price a database of about 2.4 million contracts with 78 million cashflows in up to 3.5 minutes using a 8 core machine. The solution uses plain simple Julia code, some parallel computation and buffering strategies, Julia's native serialization for fast-loading data from the disk, and a handful of packages. BusinessDays.jl and InterestRates.jl packages will be featured.
